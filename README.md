# Code-Practice
Code for at least an hour daily, share repos, record challenges to overcome them, and repeat the next day

## Specs
For everyday I code, I will post, update, and share a repo of what I did that day. The only exception would be if I'm working on a private project (for a client), or I do not have permission to share a contribution from the authorizing body (for proprietary or academic reasons). In the case of the latter, I may only share a few code snippets, or a blog link to a post where I wrote about the project.
